	<p2>Undertow (aka DTech MC) is no stranger to the stage. Since releasing his debut LP “Minds Believing” in 2010, he’s gone on to release 2 more albums with live EDM outfit Kobra Kai. Over his career he has been a regular on the National Touring Circuit, including appearances at large festivals such as “Stereosonic”, “Creamfields” and the “Big Day Out”. Along the way he has shared the stage with some of the best in the business, including Skrillex, Deadmau5, Caspa, Dizee Rascal, Scratch Perverts, Dr Octagon, Lyrics Born, DJ Q-Bert, Whether over Drum N Bass riddims, or Heavy Hip Hop beats, the art of connecting metaphors and syllables over crafted instrumentals is, and always will be, Undertow’s passion.</p2>
